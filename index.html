          <h3>1. Use rule of thirds to compose your pictures.</h3>
          <p class="tips">Rule of thirds is a popular composition technique which is supported by research evidence, where it is more memorable than other composition techniques. 
            As such, rule of thirds could improve the memorability of your home advertisements. 
           To use this technique: Imagine the picture you are about to take has 2 vertical and 2 horizontal lines on top of it.
            By Placing the focus of your image along intersection of these 2 lines you could make your image more memorable to
            home-buyers.  </p>

          <h3>2. Avoid cluttered images</h3>
          <p class="tips">Images that have complicated backgrounds, perhaps with excessive decorative items are less
            memorable than images with simple backgrounds. Make sure your rooms are not overly decorated.
            Try to find a balance between simple decoration specific to the image so that individuals will remember

          <h3>3. Edit your photos </h3>
          <p class="tips"> Use free photo-editing tools, such as Gimp, to edit images of your home.
            Make sure to increase the sharpness of your images, as sharper photos are more memorable. Also, try to increase
            the saturation of your photo to make it more vibrant. Avoid having cooler hued photos, like blue or
            purple as these are less memorable than warmer hues.</p>

          <h3>4. Avoid an exterior shot as the first image</h3>
          <p class="tips"> It is important that the first image seen by potential buyers is memorable, although it may
            be helpful for potential buyers to have a visualisation of the exterior,
            exterior shots are less memorable to people than photos of interiors.
            As such, it should not be the focal point of your advertisement.
            <br><br>Therefore, make sure that an exterior image is not the first image potential buyers see.
            It would be beneficial to place exterior images last, and instead have the first image as the kitchen or
            living room.<br><br>
            If you wish to include exterior photos, make sure you saturate them to improve their memorability as
            described in tip 3.

          <h3>6. Emphasise distinctive objects in your home</h3>
          <p class="tips">In order to increase the memorability of your advertisement, we suggest using images that
            include
            distinctive and unusual objects in your home.<br>
            <br>Unusual objects could be oversized lights, sculptures and
            distinctive features including large windows. Highlighting these distinctive and unusual features of your
            property in the images will increase the memorability of your advertisement to home-buyers and as a result
            increase the likelihood of selling your home.<br><br>
            You could also make these the focus of your image using the rule of thirds
            technique discussed above.</p>

          <h3>7. Label your photos</h3>
          <p class="tips">Using simple room label abels when creating your advertisements can be helpful for increasing
            memorability.
            When creating your advertisements, labels should be edited on each image to inform buyers of the rooms'
            purpose.
            <br><br>Something as simple as a label saying ‘living room’ on the image of the living room can greatly
            increase the memorability of
            the image. This is especially helpful if the flat you are advertising is unfurnished, as the labels give
            each room a purpose
            and it allows buyers to visualise what it would look like using any previous information they have on these
            rooms and what
            they should look like.</p>

          <h3>8.Include people in your images</h3>
          <p class="tips">This option may not be for everyone, however the most effective way to maximise memorability
            of your home ad is including people in your images.
            <br><br>Across the research on image memorability, consistently images with people are the most memorable
            images.
            Simple additions such as, having someone cooking in the kitchen or sitting in the living room could make
            your ad more memorable than photos of furnished or empty rooms. </p>
